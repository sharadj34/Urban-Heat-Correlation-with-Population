# Urban Heat - Correlation with Population

## Overview
This research project investigates the correlation between urban heat and population growth using data from Delhi (1995â€“2024). The study analyzes various factors such as population density, land surface temperature, built-up area, vegetation cover, anthropogenic heat emissions, albedo effect, traffic density, air pollution levels, impervious surface area, and water bodies. A NetLogo model has been developed to visualize the impact of population growth on urban heat trends.
